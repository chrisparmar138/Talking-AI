# 🤖 Talking-AI — Voice Command Based Assistant Project

Talking-AI is a practice-based voice assistant project that allows the user to interact using voice commands. The project is designed to simulate an assistant-style application where the program listens to user input, processes the command, and performs related actions on the system.

The project focuses on basic voice input handling, command processing, and action-execution workflow in a simple interactive environment.

## ✨ Features

### 🗣 Voice Interaction
- Accepts voice commands from the user
- Converts speech into text
- Processes the command and generates a response

### 🖥 System Interaction
- Can perform system-level actions (where permitted)
- Can open / trigger certain applications or functions
- Works in request → process → action flow

### 💬 Response Handling
- Provides output or performs relevant actions
- Supports repeated interaction

## 📂 Main Components in the Project

- Voice input & command capture
- Command interpretation / processing logic
- Output / response handling
- System-level action execution flow
- Basic UI / interaction screen
